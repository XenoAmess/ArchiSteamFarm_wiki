ASF supports variety of commands, which can be used to control behaviour of the process and bot instances.

Below commands can be sent to the bot through three different ways:
- Through steam private chat, by ```SteamMasterID```
- Through steam group chat, by ```SteamMasterID```
- Through **[WCF](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/WCF)**

### Notes

All commands are case-insensitive, but their arguments (such as bot names) are usually case-sensitive.

Plural arguments, such as ```<Bots>``` or ```<appIDs>``` mean that command supports multiple arguments of given type, separated by a comma. For example, ```!status <Bots>``` can be used as ```!status MyBot,MyOtherBot,Primary```. In addition to that, there is special ```ASF``` keyword which acts as "all bots in the process", so ```!status ASF``` is equal to ```!status all,your,bots,listed,here```.

It's nice to note that ```<Bots>``` also supports special "range" syntax, which allows you to choose a range of bots more easily. The general syntax for ```<Bots>``` in this case is ```firstBot..lastBot```. For example, if you have bots named ```A, B, C, D, E, F```, you can execute ```!status B..E```, which is equal to ```!status B,C,D,E``` in this case. When using this syntax, ASF will use alphabetical sorting in order to determine which bots are in your specified range. Both ```firstBot``` and ```lastBot``` must be valid bot names recognized by ASF, otherwise range syntax is entirely skipped.

```!pause~``` command can also be executed by up to 5 users that **[have access to our shared library](https://store.steampowered.com/account/managedevices)**, in addition to usual ```SteamMasterID```.

Commands affecting ASF as a process, or more than one bot, typically require ```SteamOwnerID``` permission, for example ```!update``` or ```!exit```. ```SteamMasterID``` has access only to his bot instances, while entire ASF process is owned by ```SteamOwnerID```. Typically commands that do not support ```<Bots>``` parameter require ```SteamOwnerID``` permission.

---

Please note that sending a command to the group chat acts like a relay - if you're saying ```!redeem X``` to 3 of your bots sitting together with you on the group chat, it'll result in the same as you'd say ```!redeem X``` to every single one of them privately. In most cases **this is not what you want**, and instead you should use ```given bot``` command that is being sent to a single bot privately. ASF supports group chat, as in many cases it can be useful source for communication with it, but you should almost never execute any command on the group chat if there are 2 or more ASF bots sitting there, unless you fully understand ASF behaviour written here and you in fact want to relay the same command to every single bot that is listening to you.

---

Some commands are also available with their aliases, to save you on typing:

| Command     | Alias |
|-------------|-------|
`!owns ASF`   | `!oa` |
`!status ASF` | `!sa` |
`!redeem`     | `!r`  |
`!redeem^`    | `!r^` |
`!redeem&`    | `!r&` |

---

It's not required to have any extra account for executing commands though Steam chat - you can create a group, set ```SteamMasterClanID``` properly to that newly created group, then set ```SteamMasterID``` as yourself. This way ASF bot (you) will join group and chat of your selected group, and listen to commands from your own account. You can join the same group chatroom in order to issue commands to yourself (as you'll be sending command to chatroom, and ASF instance sitting on the same chatroom will receive them, even if it shows only as your account being there). Apart from that, you can also use **[WCF](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/WCF)**, but chatroom way is much easier, and if you have access to some alt account, then using that instead is even easier.

---

When using **WCF**, keep in mind that:
- Commands don't have to be prefixed by ```!```, ASF prefixes them for you if needed (useful on Unix)
- When using commands that are based on ```current bot instance```, ASF will choose **any** of currently enabled bots, therefore it's highly recommended to use ```given bot instances``` commands instead.

---

## ```!input``` command

Input command can be used only in ```Headless``` mode, for inputting given data via WCF or Steam chat when ASF is running without support for user interaction.

General syntax is ```!input <Bots> <Type> <Value>```.

```<Type>``` is case-insensitive and defines input type recognized by ASF. Currently ASF recognizes following types:

| Type                    | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DeviceID                | 2FA device identificator, if missing from ```.maFile```.                   |
| Login                   | ```SteamLogin``` bot config property, if missing from config.              |
| Password                | ```SteamPassword``` bot config property, if missing from config.           |
| SteamGuard              | Auth code sent on your e-mail if you're not using 2FA.                     |
| SteamParentalPIN        | ```SteamParentalPIN``` bot config property, if missing from config.        |
| TwoFactorAuthentication | 2FA token generated from your mobile, if you're using 2FA but not ASF 2FA. |

```<Value>``` is value set for given type. Currently all values are strings.

---

### Example

Let's say that we have a bot that is protected by SteamGuard in non-2FA mode. We want to launch that bot with ```Headless``` set to true.

In order to do that, we need to execute following commands:

```!start MySteamGuardBot``` -> Bot will attempt to log in, fail due to AuthCode needed, then stop due to running in ```Headless``` mode.

```!input MySteamGuardBot SteamGuard ABCDE``` -> We set ```SteamGuard``` input of ```MySteamGuardBot``` bot to ```ABCDE```. Of course, ```ABCDE``` in this case is auth code that we got on our e-mail.

```!start MySteamGuardBot``` -> We start our (stopped) bot again, this time it automatically uses auth code that we set in previous command, properly logging in, then clearing it.

In the same way we can access 2FA-protected bots (if they're not using ASF 2FA), as well as setting other required properties during runtime.
