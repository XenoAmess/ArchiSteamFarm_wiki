# Import (ASF V1)

### Are you lost? This is legacy wiki page for ASF versions V0.X and V1.X. For newer ASF versions starting from V2.0, ASF already includes built-in support for ```.maFile``` files. This page is no longer updated neither maintained, and it's stored for archival purposes only.

This page covers topics about importing data from other applications like Steam Desktop Authenticator. ASF now covers the automatic import of *.maFile-Files, which are the Standard-Authentification-Files for Steam Desktop Authenticator.

## Import Auth-Files from Steam Desktop Authenticator (SDA)

ASF and SDA are using the same Files for 2FA-Authentication and this said you can import the .maFile-Files from SDA as .auth-Files for ASF. All we need is a little batch-script to rename the SDA-Files so they fit ASF. Normally you would use "username.xml" in ASF. Create a folder on your desktop and Backup(!!) your .maFiles from SDA. Then copy all your .maFile-Files into this folder. Then create a textfile, give it a name and change the file-extension to ".bat", open the file with a texteditor, copy&paste the following script, save and close the file, double-click it to start and use it to rename the files from (SteamID64)(.maFile) to (SteamLoginName)(.auth). **This will only work if you use config-files with the scheme (SteamLoginName)(.xml), but you can modify this script easily.**

```batch
@echo off
setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion

echo This script will search for files in _this_ directory with (.maFile)-Extension and replace them with "username(.auth)"
set /p=Hit ENTER to continue...

for %%F in (*.maFile) do (

	for /f "tokens=1" %%i in (%%F) do (
		for /f "tokens=14 delims=:," %%a in ("%%i") do (
			set user=%%~na.auth
			ren "%%F" "!user!"
			echo Filename %%F replaced with !user!
		)
	)

)

pause
```

Maybe you discover that some of your xml-configs saved with lower- and uppercase usernames. The .maFile-Files from SDA only using lowercase login-names and if you have uppercase characters in your ASF config-Filenames they couldnÂ´t match. **Linux is case-sensitive - Windows case-insensitive (Archi)** Same as before, create a folder, backup your xml-Configs, copy all xml-Configs into this folder, create a textfile, name it, replace file-Extension with ".bat", open the file with a texteditor and copy&paste the following script, save and close the file, double-click it to rename all files to lowercase.

```batch
@echo off
setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion

echo This script will rename all files in this directory to lowercase.
set /p=Hit ENTER to continue...

for /f "Tokens=*" %%f in ('dir /l/b/a-d') do (ren "%%f " "%%f ")
echo All files were renamed to lowercase. You can close this window now.
