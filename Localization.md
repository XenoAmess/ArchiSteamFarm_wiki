# Localization

ASF is powered by Crowdin service, which makes it possible for everybody to help translating ASF into all languages spoken worldwide. For more detailed explanation how Crowdin works, please check out **[Crowdin introduction](https://support.crowdin.com/crowdin-intro/)**.

If you're interested in what is currently going on, you can check **[ASF Crowdin activity](http://l10n.asf.justarchi.net/project/archisteamfarm/activity_stream)**.

## Signing up

If you'd like to help with ASF, either by translating, reviewing or approving translations, please sign up on our **[Crowdin project page](http://l10n.asf.justarchi.net/)**. Registration is easy and absolutely free! After logging in you can pick languages that you'd like to get assigned to, then proceed to ASF strings and help the rest of the community with translating ASF into all most popular languages!

### Translating

If the language of your choice is still missing some strings, you can grab them and start working on the translation. We tried to do our best in terms of flexibility of the translations, therefore many strings include extra variables that ASF will provide during runtime - those are enclosed in brackets with a number, such as ```{0}```. This allows you to alter default ASF format of the string, e.g. by moving ASF-provided variable in a place that satisfies your language and your translation, instead of being forced to strict context and format. This is especially important in RTL languages, such as Hebrew.

### Reviewing

If your string was already translated by somebody else, you can vote for it. Voting makes it possible to choose the best variant of the translation, instead of sticking with initial suggestion - this enhances overall translating quality. You can vote on already available suggestions, or suggest your own translation, which will go through the same process. Eventually, final string will be chosen either based on most voted suggestion, or as a choice of proofreader selected for that language who personally approves given translation (based on your votes as well).

**You do not need approval to see your translated strings in ASF**. Approval simply means that somebody trusted reviewed the content, as in - picked the final version of the translation. It's totally fine to have not-approved community-driven translations, where you vote for the best one. As long as it's translated, everything is fine! And if you think that current translation is bad, you can always vote for better one, or suggest one yourself! üëç

### Proof-reading

It's a good idea to have a consistent translation, even if it could potentially take freedom from community review/voting process explained above. This is mainly because incorrect translations that are not necessarily bad might get so many upvotes that it's no longer possible to suggest any better translation, even if somebody has such.

If you have past history of contributions on Crowdin or any other localization platform/service that I can verify and assume trustworthy, I'm happy to give you a proof-reader access to given language you're contributing to, so you'll be able to approve given translation and make it consistent. Proof-reading is not an easy task, especially because ASF can be very "technical" from time to time and really difficult to translate, but I understand that it's often needed for a perfect translation. Therefore if you can help by proof-reading given language, **[let us know](http://l10n.asf.justarchi.net/mail/compose/JustArchi)**, but keep in mind that you'll need to back up your request with past localization contributions that we can verify. We might also allow more advanced users to pick up initial proof-reading, if we know them personally and they're capable of cooperating with the rest of the community in order to write the best translation.

### Issues

If you have a problem with particular translation, e.g. you do not know how to translate it, approved translation is incorrect, you need more specific context, or likewise, please post a comment under specific string, and mark it with [X] Issue.

**Please avoid using issue mark if you do not need technical/development explanation or admin action**. You're free to use comments for discussion related to translation of given string, but issue should be used only when you need further technical explanation or admin correction, and it will typically involve somebody who do not even speak the language you're translating, so please stick with English when writing issue comment (so we can understand what the issue is).

If the case needs language correction, e.g. when dealing with incorrect translations that were approved already, typically proofreader will re-evaluate the case and change approval into another one (if needed).

### States

Every language that was included for translation can have one of three states:

**Needs Translation** - some strings are still left in English, initial translations needed. If you speak given language and can help, please do!

**Translated, but Needs to be Voted** - all required strings are translated, but there is still room for improvement through voting and suggesting better ones. This will be the most common state, as it simply means that "translation is completed and being improved by the community now". Please note that this state is temporary and might quickly change into previous one if any new strings will be added or modified.

**Completed** - chosen proofreader verified the translation to be correct, and picked final version of the strings, while still accepting future improvements. Quite rare, usually involves some trusted member to review community effort made in two points above, or solve conflicts.

ASF will include given language **as soon as possible**, which means that it doesn't need to be approved, or even 100% translated. The actual string that will be used is always the most popular one in terms of the votes, unless chosen proofreader decided otherwise (rarily). Therefore, you can see your efforts included in the very next ASF release, as soon as translation is pushed to Crowdin - we merge localization updates typically the moment we're about to release new ASF version.

## Missing languages

By default ASF project has open translation only for top 30 languages that are spoken worldwide. If you'd like to add another one (or a local dialect to already available one), please **[let us know](http://l10n.asf.justarchi.net/mail/compose/JustArchi)** and we'll add it ASAP. We don't want to open several hundred different languages if nobody is going to translate them, that's why we limited it to some fair number. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you'd like to translate some not-listed language, it's very easy for us to add another one.
