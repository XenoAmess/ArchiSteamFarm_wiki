# Localization

ASF is powered by Crowdin service, which makes it possible for everybody to help translating ASF into all languages spoken worldwide. For more detailed explanation how Crowdin works, please check out **[Crowdin introduction](https://support.crowdin.com/crowdin-intro/)**.

If you're interested in what is currently going on, you can check **[ASF Crowdin activity](http://l10n.asf.justarchi.net/project/archisteamfarm/activity_stream)**.

## Signing up

If you'd like to help with ASF, either by translating, reviewing or approving translations, please sign up on our **[Crowdin project page](http://l10n.asf.justarchi.net/)**. Registration is easy and absolutely free! After logging in you can pick languages that you'd like to get assigned to, then proceed to ASF strings and help the rest of the community to translate ASF into all most popular languages!

### Translating

If the language of your choice is still missing some strings, you can grab them and start working on the translation. We tried to do our best in terms of flexibility of the translations, therefore many strings include extra variables that ASF will provide during runtime - those are enclosed in brackets with a number, such as ```{0}```. This allows you to alter default ASF format of the string, e.g. by moving ASF-provided variable in a place that satisfies your language and your translation, instead of being forced to strict context and format.

### Reviewing

If your string was already translated by somebody else, you can vote for it. Voting makes it possible to choose the best variant of the translation, instead of sticking with initial suggestion, which enhances translating quality. You can vote on already available suggestions, or suggest your own translation, which will go through the same process. Eventually, final string will be chosen either based on most voted suggestion, or as a choice of proofreader selected for that language who personally approves given translation (based on your votes as well).

**You do not need approval to see your translated strings in ASF**. Approval simply means that somebody trusted reviewed the content, as in - picked the final version of the translation. It's totally fine to have not-approved community-driven translations, where you vote for the best one. As long as it's translated, everything is fine! And if you think that current translation is bad, you can always vote for better one, or suggest one yourself! üëç

### Issues

If you have a problem with particular translation, e.g. you do not know how to translate it, approved translation is incorrect, you need more specific context, or likewise, please post a comment under specific string, and mark it with [X] Issue.

**Please avoid using issue mark if you do not need technical/development explanation or admin action**. You're free to use comments for discussion related to translation of given string, but issue should be used only when you need further technical explanation or admin correction, and it will typically involve somebody who do not even speak the language you're translating, so please stick with English when writing issue comment (so we can understand what the issue is).

If the case needs language correction, e.g. when dealing with incorrect translations that were approved already, typically proofreader will re-evaluate the case and change approval into another one (if needed).

## Missing languages

By default ASF project has open translation only for top 30 languages that are spoken worldwide. If you'd like to add another one (or a local dialect to already available one), please **[let us know](http://l10n.asf.justarchi.net/mail/compose/JustArchi)** and we'll add it ASAP.
