GitHub **[issues](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/issues)** page is being used for ASF TODO list, regarding both features and bugs. It has rather strict policy - GitHub is not technical support and all cases which are not suggestions or bug reports should NOT be posted there. You have ASF chat and Steam group for general discussion, questions or technical issues.
