# Commands

## This page applies to ASF V3 only. If you're using ASF V2, please visit **[ASF V2](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/_Commands-(ASF-V2))** page instead.

ASF supports variety of commands, which can be used to control behaviour of the process and bot instances.

Below commands can be sent to the bot through three different ways:
- Through steam private chat
- Through steam group chat
- Through **[IPC](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC)**

Keep in mind that ASF interaction requires from you to be eligible for the command according to ASF permissions. Check out `SteamUserPermissions` and `SteamOwnerID` config properties for more details.

---

### Steam private chat

Definitely the easiest method to interact with ASF - simply execute command to ASF bot that is currently running in ASF process. Obviously, you can't do that if you're running ASF with a single bot account that is your own.

### Steam group chat

Very similar to above, but this time on group chat of given Steam group. Keep in mind that this option requires either `SteamMasterClanID` properly set, or you inviting your bot to chat manually. This can actuall be used to "talking to yourself" and doesn't require dedicated bot account.

---

### IPC

Probably the most "complex" method of calling ASF, perfect for third-party tools or scripting, requires ASF to be run in server mode, and a client executing command through **[IPC](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC)** interface.

### Notes

All commands are case-insensitive, but their arguments (such as bot names) are usually case-sensitive.

**Access** of the command defines **minimum** `EPermission` of `SteamUserPermissions` that is required to use the command, with an exception of `Owner` which is `SteamOwnerID` defined in global configuration file (and highest permission available).

Plural arguments, such as `<Bots>`, `<Keys>` or `<AppIDs>` mean that command supports multiple arguments of given type, separated by a comma. For example, `!status <Bots>` can be used as `!status MyBot,MyOtherBot,Primary`. This will cause given command to be executed on **all target bots** in the same way as you'd send `!status` to each bot in a separate chat window. Please note that there is no space after `,`.

A space is being used as a delimiter for a command, therefore it can't be used in arguments. ASF supports mapping of `_` character into a space character in some selected commands, namely `!nickname` and `!owns`. You can use this mapping in order to use spaces in your argument, for example by executing `!owns 7_wonders` in order to check if bot owns game named "7 wonders".

For `<Bots>` argument, there is a special `ASF` keyword which acts as "all bots in the process", so `!status ASF` is equal to `!status all,your,bots,listed,here`.

It's nice to note that `<Bots>` also supports special "range" syntax, which allows you to choose a range of bots more easily. The general syntax for `<Bots>` in this case is `firstBot..lastBot`. For example, if you have bots named `A, B, C, D, E, F`, you can execute `!status B..E`, which is equal to `!status B,C,D,E` in this case. When using this syntax, ASF will use alphabetical sorting in order to determine which bots are in your specified range. Both `firstBot` and `lastBot` must be valid bot names recognized by ASF, otherwise range syntax is entirely skipped.

---

Please note that sending a command to the group chat acts like a relay - if you're saying `!redeem X` to 3 of your bots sitting together with you on the group chat, it'll result in the same as you'd say `!redeem X` to every single one of them privately. In most cases **this is not what you want**, and instead you should use `given bot` command that is being sent to a single bot privately. ASF supports group chat, as in many cases it can be useful source for communication with it, but you should almost never execute any command on the group chat if there are 2 or more ASF bots sitting there, unless you fully understand ASF behaviour written here and you in fact want to relay the same command to every single bot that is listening to you.

*And even in this case you should use `<Bots>` syntax instead.*

---

Some commands are also available with their aliases, to save you on typing:

| Command     | Alias |
|-------------|-------|
`!owns ASF`   | `!oa` |
`!status ASF` | `!sa` |
`!redeem`     | `!r`  |
`!redeem^`    | `!r^` |

---

It's not required to have any extra account for executing commands though Steam chat - you can create a group, set `SteamMasterClanID` properly to that newly created group, then give yourself access either through `SteamOwnerID` or `SteamUserPermissions` of your own bot. This way ASF bot (you) will join group and chat of your selected group, and listen to commands from your own account. You can join the same group chatroom in order to issue commands to yourself (as you'll be sending command to chatroom, and ASF instance sitting on the same chatroom will receive them, even if it shows only as your account being there). Apart from that, you can also use **[IPC](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC)**, but chatroom way is much easier, and if you have access to some alt account, then using that instead is even easier.

---

When using **IPC**, keep in mind that:
- Commands don't have to be prefixed by `!`, ASF prefixes them for you if needed (useful for URL encoding)
- When using commands that are based on `current bot instance`, ASF will choose **any** of currently enabled bots, therefore it's highly recommended to use `given bot instances` commands instead.

## `!redeem^` modes

`!redeem^` command allows you to fine-tune modes that will be used for one single redeem scenario. This works as temporary override of `RedeemingPreferences` **[bot config property](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)**.

`<modes>` argument accepts multiple mode values, separates as usual by a comma. Available mode values are specified below:

Value | Name  | Description
--- | --- | ---
FD | ForceDistributing | Forces `Distributing` redeeming preference to be enabled
FF | ForceForwarding | Forces `Forwarding` redeeming preference to be enabled
FKMG | ForceKeepMissingGames | Forces `KeepMissingGames` redeeming preference to be enabled
SD | SkipDistributing | Forces `Distributing` redeeming preference to be disabled
SF | SkipForwarding | Forces `Forwarding` redeeming preference to be disabled
SI | SkipInitial | Skips key redemption on initial bot
SKMG | SkipKeepMissingGames | Forces `KeepMissingGames` redeeming preference to be disabled
V | Validate | Validates keys for proper format and automatically skips invalid ones

For example, we'd like to redeem 3 keys on any of our bots that don't own games yet, but not our `primary` bot. For achieving that we can use:

`!redeem^ primary FF,SI key1,key2,key3`

---

## `!transfer` modes

`<modes>` argument accepts multiple mode values, separates as usual by a comma. Available mode values are specified below:

Value | Alias | Description
--- | --- | ---
All | A | Same as enabling all item types below
Background | BG | Profile background to use on your Steam profile
Booster | BO | Booster pack
Card | C | Steam trading card, being used for crafting badges (non-foil)
Emoticon | E | Emoticon to use in Steam Chat
Foil | F | Foil variant of `Card`
Gems | G | Steam gems being used for crafting boosters, sacks included
Unknown | U | Every type that doesn't fit in any of the above

For example, in order to send trading cards and foils from `MyBot` to `MyMain`, you'd execute:

`!transfer MyBot C,F MyMain`

---

## `!input` command

Input command can be used only in `Headless` mode, for inputting given data via **[IPC](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC)** or Steam chat when ASF is running without support for user interaction.

General syntax is `!input <Bots> <Type> <Value>`.

`<Type>` is case-insensitive and defines input type recognized by ASF. Currently ASF recognizes following types:

| Type                    | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DeviceID                | 2FA device identificator, if missing from `.maFile`.                       |
| Login                   | `SteamLogin` bot config property, if missing from config.                  |
| Password                | `SteamPassword` bot config property, if missing from config.               |
| SteamGuard              | Auth code sent on your e-mail if you're not using 2FA.                     |
| SteamParentalPIN        | `SteamParentalPIN` bot config property, if missing from config.            |
| TwoFactorAuthentication | 2FA token generated from your mobile, if you're using 2FA but not ASF 2FA. |

`<Value>` is value set for given type. Currently all values are strings.

### Example

Let's say that we have a bot that is protected by SteamGuard in non-2FA mode. We want to launch that bot with `Headless` set to true.

In order to do that, we need to execute following commands:

`!start MySteamGuardBot` -> Bot will attempt to log in, fail due to AuthCode needed, then stop due to running in `Headless` mode.

`!input MySteamGuardBot SteamGuard ABCDE` -> We set `SteamGuard` input of `MySteamGuardBot` bot to `ABCDE`. Of course, `ABCDE` in this case is auth code that we got on our e-mail.

`!start MySteamGuardBot` -> We start our (stopped) bot again, this time it automatically uses auth code that we set in previous command, properly logging in, then clearing it.

In the same way we can access 2FA-protected bots (if they're not using ASF 2FA), as well as setting other required properties during runtime.
