# Statistics

ASF development is supported by 3 major things: donations, users feedback, and statistics. Donations directly influence our willings to work on the project, users feedback is always nice to read (especially positive one), while statistics are providing us with the information how our software is used, and by how many people - this way we can know what to improve, as well as we can estimate number of users. ASF in default settings has ```Statistics``` global config property enabled. If you want to see new versions coming up, bugs being fixed, and new features getting implemented, you should consider keeping them on, so we can make use of that data in order to provide you with a better software (but not only). This is especially important because ASF is given to you **for free**, and this is the least you can do to say thanks - **tell us that you're using ASF**, because this is what our current statistics are mainly doing.

## Current privacy policy

When ```Statistics``` are active, following things will happen:

1. Every account being used in ASF will join our **[steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ascfarm)**. This is done for three reasons:

* It provides **you** with group announcements, especially new versions, critical issues, steam problems and other things that are important to keep community updated
* It allows **you** to use our technical support, by asking questions, resolving problems, reporting issues or suggesting improvements
* It allows us to see how many actual steam accounts are being used by ASF


2. ASF will periodically send useful data about your accounts to our **[server](https://asf.justarchi.net)**. Actual data consists of following account-related information:

* Your SteamID (in 64-bit form)
* Your Avatar (hash)
* Value specifying if you're using **[ASF 2FA](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Escrow)**
* Value specifying if you've enabled ```SteamTradeMatcher``` in your ```TradingPreferences```
* Value specifying if you've enabled ```MatchEverything``` in your ```TradingPreferences```

ASF will **not** gather any other non-listed-above data without prior important ([!]) notice in the changelog.

## Usage of data

Your SteamID, Avatar, ASF 2FA status, SteamTradeMatcher status and MatchEverything status is being used for our **[public database of ASF-powered SteamTradeMatcher bots with ASF 2FA](https://asf.justarchi.net/STM)**. This way every interested user can easily notice bots that are currently active, and send STM trade offer, which helps that user as well as **you**, as both of you are getting rid of duplicate cards and heading towards badge completion. We wanted to create something like this for a long time, as **everybody** appreciates instant response to trade offers that ASF includes, which can drastically improve efficiency of matching, as well as information about bots availability.

## Opting out

Participating in statistics is **not mandatory**, although highly encouraged for future of the program. We do not judge you, and if you have inner urge of hiding the fact that you're ASF user (ðŸ˜­) then you can disable statistics **entirely** by switching ```Statistics``` global config property to ```false```. Disabled statistics make entire module non-operative, and will not do any of actions specified in our privacy policy above.

> Please note that disabling statistics might influence our technical support and other things that are offered to you (for free).
