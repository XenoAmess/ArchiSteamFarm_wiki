# 首頁

歡迎使用 ASF Wiki。 Wiki 是一個涵蓋許多主題的線上說明，包括可能的問題、用法、設置等。 如果您想瞭解 ASF 的工作原理, 尤其是如何安裝、配置和使用 ASF, 則應遵循以下步驟。

您可以通過向任何訪問的頁面地址添加 `-locale` 字串以更改Wiki語言。 例如, 您可以訪問翻譯成俄語的主頁 (如果俄語可用) 的 **[Home-ru-RU](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Home-ru-RU)**, 而不是訪問 **[Home](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Home)**。 在社區中達成90% 或更多當地語系化的語言將在我們的 wiki 側邊欄 (右側) 上提供, 以便於訪問。

除非另有說明 (如 "v2"), 所有 wiki 頁面始終適用于 **最新發佈的ASF版本</0 >。 If you'd like to see a wiki page in given fixed point of time (for example for a bit older ASF release), use **[revisions](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/_history)** that are available on top of each page and pick a date that is appropriate for the date of your ASF release. We keep all pages available for current, as well as previous major ASF version.</p> 

If you're a new user, we recommend starting with **[setting up](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Setting-up)** guide. You can find all other relevant wiki pages on our sidebar, on the right side of the screen. We suggest to start from the top, although feel free to read anything that seems remotely interesting to you, there are no limits on ASF knowledge.

If you need further help, you can ask on our **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/hSQgt8j)**, or in the **[discussions of our steam group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/archiasf/discussions/1)**. Consider using discord chat for small questions or discussing common ASF things, and group thread for general issues and bugs reporting.

GitHub **[issues](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/issues)** page is being used for ASF "todo" list, regarding both features and bugs. It has rather strict policy - GitHub is not technical support and all cases that are not suggestions or bug reports should NOT be posted there. You have ASF discord and Steam group for general discussion, questions or technical issues. Please avoid using GitHub issues, unless you indeed want to report a bug or suggest an enhancement. Even prior to doing that, please make sure that you're indeed dealing with a bug, or your suggestion makes sense, preferably by asking on discord/steam group first. Invalid issues will be closed immediately and won't be answered.
