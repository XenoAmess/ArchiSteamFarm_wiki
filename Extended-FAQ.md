### Who has created ASF?

ASF was created by **[Archi](https://github.com/JustArchi)** in October 2015. In case you were wondering, I'm a **[Steam user](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006963719)** that loves playing games, just like you, but apart from playing games I also love to put my skills and determination to use, which you can explore right now. There is no big company involved here, a team of developers and a $1M of budget to cover all of that - just me, fixing things that are not broken.

However, ASF is open-source project, and I can't express enough that I'm not behind everything that you can enjoy here. Yes, I'm still behind majority of things, including core of ASF, but you should be aware that entire **[Web-based ConfigGenerator](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#web-based-configgenerator)** was coded by **[@Mole](https://github.com/Aareksio)**, while **[@MrBurrBurr](https://github.com/MrBurrBurr)** is behind **[IPC GUI](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC#ipc-gui)**. Apart from that, ASF also has a lot of other **[contributors](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/graphs/contributors)** that also helped a lot to make all of this happen. On top of that, there are a lot of third-party services supporting ASF development, especially **[GitHub](https://github.com)**,  **[Discord](https://discordapp.com)**, **[AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com)**, **[Travis](https://travis-ci.com)**, **[ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper)** and **[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com)**. And of course you can't forget about all the awesome libraries and tools that made ASF happen, especially **[SteamKit2](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit)** without which ASF would not exist.
