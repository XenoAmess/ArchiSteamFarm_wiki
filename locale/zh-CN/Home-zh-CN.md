欢迎阅读ASF Wiki！ Wiki 是一份在线帮助文档，涵盖众多不同类别的主题，包括常见问题、可能遇到的问题、使用方法、设置等等。 如果你希望学习ASF的使用方法，比如说安装、配置以及使用方面，那么这个你需要关注这个页面。

你可以在任何 Wiki 网页后加上 `-locale` 语言后缀来更改页面语言。 例如， 在查看 **[FAQ](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ)** 时，你可以改为查看 **[FAQ-ru-RU](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ-ru-RU)** 来获得翻译为俄罗斯语的页面(如果翻译可用的话)。

All wiki pages always apply to **[latest ASF release](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases)** only, unless stated otherwise (like "V2"). If you'd like to see a wiki page in given fixed point of time (for example for a bit older ASF release), use **[revisions](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/_history)** that are available on top of each page and pick a date that is appropriate for the date of your ASF release. We keep all pages available for current, as well as previous major ASF version.

If you're a new user, we recommend starting with **[setting up](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Setting-up)** guide. You can find all other relevant wiki pages on our sidebar, on the right side of the screen. We recommend to start from the top, although feel free to read anything that seems remotely interesting to you, there are no limits on ASF knowledge.

If you need further help, you can ask on our **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/hSQgt8j)**, or in the **[discussions of our steam group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ascfarm/discussions/1)**. Consider using discord chat for small questions or discussing common ASF things, and group thread for general issues and bugs reporting.

GitHub **[issues](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/issues)** page is being used for ASF "todo" list, regarding both features and bugs. It has rather strict policy - GitHub is not technical support and all cases that are not suggestions or bug reports should NOT be posted there. You have ASF discord and Steam group for general discussion, questions or technical issues. Please avoid using GitHub issues, unless you indeed want to report a bug or suggest an enhancement. Even prior to doing that, please make sure that you're indeed dealing with a bug, or your suggestion makes sense, preferably by asking on discord/steam group first. Invalid issues will be closed immediately and won't be answered.
