# Licença

Unless stated otherwise, ASF is licensed under **[Apache License 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/master/LICENSE-2.0.txt)**. For a quick overview what you can and cannot do, you can use **[tl;dr Legal](https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0))**.

ASF license is very permissive and you're allowed to do much more than in standard GPL license, including using ASF in commercial projects without a requirement of making code open-source. In short, as stated by tl;dr Legal:

> You can do what you like with the software, as long as you include the required notices. This permissive license contains a patent license from the contributors of the code.

Please note that various **[ASF components](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/blob/master/ArchiSteamFarm/ArchiSteamFarm.csproj)** included with `PackageReference` might be licensed under different conditions, such as **[LGPL](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-lesser-general-public-license-v3-(lgpl-3))**. Same thing applies to all other third-party projects that ASF makes use of, especially all `tools` that have their own licenses on top.
