# 首頁

歡迎使用 ASF Wiki。 Wiki 是一個涵蓋許多主題的線上說明，包括可能的問題、用法、設置等。 如果您想瞭解 ASF 的工作原理, 尤其是如何安裝、配置和使用 ASF, 則應遵循以下步驟。

您可以通過向任何訪問的頁面地址添加 `-locale` 字串以更改Wiki語言。 例如, 您可以訪問翻譯成俄語的主頁 (如果俄語可用) 的 **[Home-ru-RU](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Home-ru-RU)**, 而不是訪問 **[Home](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Home)**。 在社區中達成90% 或更多當地語系化的語言將在我們的 wiki 側邊欄 (右側) 上提供, 以便於訪問。

除非另有說明 (如 "v2"), 所有 wiki 頁面始終適用于 **最新發佈的ASF版本</0 >。 If you'd like to see a wiki page in given fixed point of time (for example for a bit older ASF release), use **[revisions](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/_history)** that are available on top of each page and pick a date that is appropriate for the date of your ASF release. We keep all pages available for current, as well as previous major ASF version.</p> 

If you're a new user, we recommend starting with **[setting up](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Setting-up)** guide. You can find all other relevant wiki pages on our sidebar, on the right side of the screen. We suggest to start from the top, although feel free to read anything that seems remotely interesting to you, there are no limits on ASF knowledge.

If you need further help, please check out our **[support channels](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/blob/master/SUPPORT.md)**, which you can use for all the questions and technical difficulties.

GitHub **[issues](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/issues)** page is being used for ASF development, especially in regards to bugs and enhancements. We have a very strict policy regarding that, as GitHub is **not** a general support channel, it's dedicated exclusively to ASF development and we're not answering common ASF matters there, as we have appropriate **[support channels](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/blob/master/SUPPORT.md)** for that. If you're not sure whether your matter relates to ASF development or not, we recommend to use a support channel instead. Invalid GitHub issues will be closed immediately and won't be answered.
