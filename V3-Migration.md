### What is ASF V3 about?

ASF V3 is next major iteration of ASF that will come as a direct replacement of ASF V2. The major version bump is about entire program rewrite from .NET Framework 4.6.1 into .NET Core 2.0.

### When ASF V3 will be available?

Pre-releases should start becoming available around mid-July, with stable release depending on feedback and progress, sometime in August (mid-August planned, maybe earlier).
