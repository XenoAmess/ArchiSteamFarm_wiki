Welcome to ASF wiki. Wiki is an online help that covers many different subjects such as frequently asked questions, possible issues, usage, setting up, and many more. This is what you should follow if you want to learn how ASF works, especially how to install, configure, and use it.

You can change wiki language by adding `-locale` string to any visited page. For example, instead of visiting **[FAQ](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ)**, you can visit **[FAQ-ru-RU](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ-ru-RU)** that contains FAQ translated into Russian (if available).

All wiki pages always apply to **[latest ASF release](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/releases)** only, unless stated otherwise (like "V2"). If you'd like to see a wiki page in given fixed point of time (for example for a bit older ASF release), use **[revisions](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Home/_history)** that are available on top of each page and pick a date that is appropriate for the date of your ASF release. We keep all pages available for current, as well as previous major ASF version.

For starters, everything that you need includes:

* **[Setting up](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Setting-up)** **(start here)**
* **[Configuration](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)**

Of course feel free to read anything that seems remotely interesting to you, there are no limits on ASF knowledge ðŸ™‚

If you need further help, you can ask for example on our **[Discord](https://discord.gg/hSQgt8j)** or in the **[discussions of our steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ascfarm/discussions/1/)**. Consider using discord chat for small questions or discussing common ASF things, and group thread for general issues and bugs reporting.

GitHub **[issues](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/issues)** page is being used for ASF TODO list, regarding both features and bugs. It has rather strict policy - GitHub is not technical support and all cases that are not suggestions or bug reports should NOT be posted there. You have ASF discord and Steam group for general discussion, questions or technical issues. Please avoid using GitHub issues, unless you indeed want to report a bug or suggest an enhancement. Even prior to doing that, please make sure that you're indeed dealing with a bug, or your suggestion makes sense, preferably by asking on discord/steam group first. Invalid issues will be closed immediately and won't be answered.
