### Who has created ASF?

ASF was created by **[Archi](https://github.com/JustArchi)** in October 2015. In case you were wondering, I'm a **[Steam user](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006963719)** that loves playing games, just like you. Apart from games I also love to put my skills and determination in use, which you're exploring right now. There is no big company involved here, a team of developers and a budget to cover all of that - just me, coding in my spare time.

However, ASF is open-source project, and I can't express enough that I'm not behind everything that you can enjoy here. Yes, I'm still behind majority of things, including core of ASF, but you should be aware that entire **[Web-based ConfigGenerator](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#web-based-configgenerator)** was coded by **[@Aareksio](https://github.com/Aareksio)**, while **[@MrBurrBurr](https://github.com/MrBurrBurr)** is behind **[IPC GUI](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC#ipc-gui)**. Apart from that, ASF also has a lot of other **[contributors](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/graphs/contributors)** that have also helped make all of this happen.
